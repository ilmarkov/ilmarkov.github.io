I am a graduate student at Institute of Science and Technology Austria ([ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/)) where I am advised by professor Dan Alistarh.  
Before joining ISTA I received my MSc in Computer Security at Moscow Institute of Science and Technology ([MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/))

My research interests include systems for machine learning, machine learning for systems 
as well as concurrent and distributed algorithms.  
My current studies focus on systems for large scale distributed deep neural network training.

In my free time I enjoy different kinds of sport, e.g. gym, tennis, swimming, hiking and intellectual games.
